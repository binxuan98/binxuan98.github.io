I'm a third year graduate student from [Lanzhou University of Technology](https://www.lut.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, natural language processing, and large language models.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiangquan Gui](https://jitong.lut.edu.cn/info/1317/8626.htm) of 810 Lab from [School of Computer and Communication](https://jitong.lut.edu.cn/index.htm), Lanzhou University of Technology.

I'm a graduate student at [Lanzhou University of Technology](https://www.lut.edu.cn/), where I was mentored by [Prof. Xiangquan Gui](https://jitong.lut.edu.cn/info/1317/8626.htm) at the 810 Lab, [School of Computer and Communication](https://jitong.lut.edu.cn/index.htm).

Currently, I am working at the [Gansu Provincial Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Computing Power Technology](https://ai.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/), under the guidance of [Prof. Yi Yang](https://xxxy.lzu.edu.cn/shiziduiwu/jiaoshiduiwu/fujiaoshou/2020/0920/132781.html).

My research interests lie in computer vision, natural language processing, and large language models, with a growing focus on multimodal learning, LLM fine-tuning, and efficient deployment on heterogeneous infrastructures.

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge theoretical research and practical applications, and I actively engage in open-source collaborations and interdisciplinary AI projects.
